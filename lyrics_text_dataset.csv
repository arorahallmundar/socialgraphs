Keď sa slnko skloní na Horehroní túžim sa k nebu priblížiť

V tom vánku, čo ma kolíše keď je slnko najnižšie

When the sun is at its lowest point The most beautiful trees are in Horehronie

I come back here when I feel sad
The trees are saying: shake it off I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
Of what, I don't even know
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point Ah... hallelujah... When the sun goes down in Horehronie
Out there somewhere far away our bell is ringing
When it hurts, let it hurt
One day it will vanish in the black mountain I'm lying on the grass and dreaming

the memories turned to smithereens as well
memories and screams,pointless wishes
In some corner(of my mind)i've left open wounds I burned ""yesterdays"",nights of the past
on fire I set dreams and nightmares
tears that burn,many lies
they look like a silent movie that I no longer watch opa I set on fire
everything that belongs on the past
I'll change everything

we can forget about the past and make a new beginning I set on fire

Do you understand what I mean?

I can see that this could be fate
I can love you more than they hate
Doesn't matter who they will blame
We can beat them at their own game

I can see it in your eyes
It doesn't come as a surprise
I see you dancing like a star
No matter how different we are

For all this time I've been loving you
Don't even know your name
For just one night, we could be the same
No matter what they say

And I feel I'm turning the page
And I feel the world is a stage
I don't think that drama will stop
I don't think they'll give up the rage

But I know the world could be great
I can love you more than they hate
Doesn't matter who they will blame
We can beat them at their own game

I can see it in your eyes
It doesn't come as a surprise
I see you dancing like a star

Jestem

Jestem - w Twym słowie, myślach, każdym geście
Jestem - jak woda, ziemia, ogień i powietrze
Jestem, w ramionach mych roztapiasz się jak lód
Czekasz, na choćby jeden uśmiech, jedno słowo
Co dnia próbujesz zdobyć mnie na nowo
Z Tobą oswoiłam się

A gdy kłopot jakiś mam
U drzwi stajesz pierwszy
Teraz wreszcie pewność mam
To Ty kwiaty do mnie ślesz co dnia

Jestem Twym natchnieniem
Dla łez ukojeniem
(Twój świat kręci się wokół mnie)
Jesteś moim cieniem
Na każde skinienie
(Pojawiasz się tuż obok mnie, skaczesz w ogień gdy chcę)

Czuję, jak raz po raz ogarnia Cię niepokój
Jak talię kart odkrywam Cię po trochu
Z Tobą zapominam się

A gdy noc kołysze nas, do snu
Myśli biegną
W stronę Twoich oczu, Twoich ust
By upewnić się że wciąż jeszcze

Jestem Twym natchnieniem

I got used to you And when I have some problem
You'll be the first at my door
Now, finally, I am certain
That you'll send me flowers everyday I am your inspiration, a solace for your tears

You are my shadow at every nod

You jump into the fire whenever I want) I feel how anxiety overcomes you again and again

Baš sam imala težak dan
Ljudi čudni su, niko ne zna za red
Kući vučem se umorna
I dok kopam po tašni da pronađem ključ
Već na ivici nerava
Moje sunce, moj mesec i zvezdice sve
Moj muškarac mi otvara
Moj je čovek na vratima
I istog trena vredim kao hiljadu žena
Jer njemu sam lepa i jaka ko stena
I kad me grli, znam da sve je u redu
Čovek je čaroban
Sve moje mrakove u proleće boji
Od kad me voli ja uspravno stojim
I njemu ja sam dobra, baš kakva jesam
Čovek je čaroban
Zbogom tugo i zdravo osmehu moj
Sreća s njim se doselila
Tako topao, nežan i predivno svoj
Samo meni on pripada
Dugo pričamo, moj je najbolji drug
S njim se smejem ko blesava
Ljudi mi kažu nisu videli par koji tako isijava
Naša ljubav je zarazna
Sada znam da vredim kao hiljadu žena

","It's freezing and everywhere there's slippery ice
I really had a bad day
The people are weird, no one has any manners
I'm tired and dragging myself home And while I'm digging through my purse, looking for my key
I'm already losing my nerves
It's my sun, my moon and all my stars
It's my man is opening the door
It's my man is at the door And at the same time I feel like I have the worth of a thousand woman
Because he thinks I'm pretty and strong as a rock
And when he hugs me, I know everything is all right
That man is magical He turns all my darkness into spring
Since he loves me, I stand tall
And I'm good enough for him, just the way I am
That man is magical I say goodbye to my sorrow and hello to my smile
Alongside him happiness has moved in
He's so warm, gentle and beautifully himself
He only belongs to me We have long talks, he's my best friend
With him I laugh like crazy
People tell me that they haven't seen
A couple that radiates that much
Our love is contagious Now I know that I have the worth of a thousand woman
Because he thinks I'm pretty and strong as a rock
And when he hugs me, I know everything is all right

Passion game that I play gonna last one more day
One more night I'll be there in my dreams again and again

Abandon painful denial, find every reason to stay
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I'm ready to pay

Pay for the hopeless despair

Turn around, all the words of regrets
And seize the chance to find the way so I can be raised
I am too lame, psycho from the brain
There is nothing I can do, that's a part of the game

In my convertible breeze

Martini
Whiskey on the rocks

My party never stops!

Winner
A dusk to dawn sinner
Love traded in for lust
It's emotions I don't trust

On top
The cream of the crop
You know I love to rock
The fun will never stop

You see
It's all about me
The servants and the king
I'm the ruler of the world

A tug
She pulls me like a drug
I want her on the rug
But she's not that kind of girl

I see you where the lights glow
You pull me in your private side show
And now I see your moves in slowmo
I try to kiss you, but you slip away

Yet you never walk away from me
Are you a shadow of what might be?
Why should one woman stand above the rest?
There is a mystery to you deep beneath the flesh!

Those eyes pulling me in
A body made to sin
But I can not win

She's where I want to be
Can't stand a moment without her
Anymore!

I see you where the lights glow
You pull me in your private side show
And now I see your moves in slowmo
I try to kiss you, but you slip away

Yet you never walk away from me
Are you a shadow of what might be?
Why should one woman stand above the rest?
There is a mystery to you deep beneath the flesh!","Flashes

The servants and the king
I'm the ruler of the world

I want her on the rug

Ο δρόμος είναι μακρυνός κι όπου με πας θα πάω
Με σταύρωσες, με μάτωσες κι ας πέθαινα για σένα
Το δάκρυ μου έρεε σαν αίμα, λόγια ξεχασμένα
Πίστευα πως οι άγγελοι ζούνε στα όνειρά μας
Ψέματα όμως πίστευα βρίσκονται ανάμεσά μας
Μια πόλη έρημη η καρδιά σαν έφυγες μακριά μου
Γύρνα ξανά σε καρτερώ, αστέρι και χαρά μου

Στον κήπο της αγάπης μας, πήγα για να σε ψάξω
Στο πλήθος όμως χάθηκες, δεν μπόρεσα να κλάψω
Το σταυροδρόμι της ψυχής κι ο μυστικός μας δείπνος
Χαθήκανε στο διάβα σου, έκλεισε πια ο κύκλος

Πες μου και πάλιν μ' αγαπάς, λύτρωσε την καρδιά μου
Σαν άγγελος σ' αγάπησα, γύρνα στην αγκαλιά μου

The road is long and wherever you guide me, I will go
You crucified me, you made me bleed even when I was dying for you
My tears were flowing like blood, forgotten words. I thought that angels live in our dreams,
But I believed in lies, they live among us
A desolate heart since you left me
Come back again, I’m waiting for you, my star and my happiness To the garden of our love, I went to look for you,
But you got lost in the crowd, I could not cry
The crossroads of soul and our secret supper
Lost in your path, the cycle is now closed. I loved you like an angel, come back into my arms,
Tell me one more time that you love me, redeem my heart
I loved you like an angel, come into my arms,
Come again and guide my wilderness to the light. I loved you like an angel",Greek,San aggelos s'agapisa,Pop,Greek

Spartu mondu cun tè
Ma tu, ti ne vogli’andà
Cantu per a vittoria
Luntanu da tè, pensu sempre che

Pregu u celu fin’a more

Je rêve de tes lèvres
De ta voix claire et pure
Jamais éteinte, je me souviens de toi
En cette nuit, ici avec toi

De la vie j’attends le lendemain
Agenouillé je regarde la mer

Je partage le monde avec toi
Mais toi tu veux partir

Loin de toi, je pense toujours que
Tu es près de moi, je rêve de toi

Je chanterai, je te chanterai
La chanson du pauvre de moi

Je pleure et je suis mal
Je prie le ciel jusqu’à en mourir
Que des montagnes il me guide en face de toi
Je sortirai de ce rêve

Si tu meurs, moi aussi","I dream of those lips,
of this clear and pure voice.
A memory never lost within me.
That night here with you. I dream, I wail.
In my heart there is no spring.
Of life I expect tomorrow.
Kneeling I guard the sea! I will share the world with you,
but you don't want to.
I dream of a victory.
I always think that, far away from you.
You are close to me, I dream of you. I will sing, I will sing to you, the song of you and me. I cry and feel bad.
I pray to the heaven till I die.

to awaken from this dream. If you die, I will stop living.",Corsican,Sognu,Ballad,Corsican
2011,Italy,Madness of Love (Follia d'amore),"Saying yes, saying never is not easy, you know
And all the world around you seems to slip and disappear
I no longer know who you are, I don't care who you are
I know for certain I won't bother you with nostalgy

But you'll see another me in a fragile dream
You'll laugh as if I had never loved you
You'll look for another me beyond the shadow of a coffee
You'll only find me
If I stop for a moment, I no longer know who you are

Here we live like this, day by day, night by night
But someone hit me and I fell into your heart, my dear
And you'll fly over lands where your eyes can't find the end
Up on mountains, down lakes
Being so far away from you just makes me feel so dead

And you will see another you, almost invincible
Alive as ever and it is there where you will have me
The horizon will be beyond false magic
You'll shine, you'll shine, you'll shine, you'll shine","Saying yes, saying never
Is not easy, you know
When all of us are in the orbit of madness
I no longer know who you are
It doesn't even matter who you are
For me it's enough to miss the charm of the nostalgia And in another fragile dream you'll see another me
You'll laugh as if
I had never loved you
You'll search for another me
Beyond the shadow of a coffee
You'll find only me
If I stop for a moment I don't know who you are That's how we live around here
Day by day
Night by night
Meanwhile the world turns away from its poetry Don't ever portray me, don't ever force me
Let's lose ourselves in the threshold of my madness But you'll see another me, a fragile, a disarmed one
Because what you are
Will never change,no
Even if I were you
As the time I'd run out
So, stay with me
I don't lose the sight of you, not even for a moment And you'll see another you
Almost invincible
Alive as never before
And that's when you'll have me
Over the false spells, you'll be the sky
And you'll shine

You'll shine

The dawn will break as darkness fades forever well be free

Never forget what I did, what I said
When I gave you all my heart and soul
Morning will come and I know well be one
Cause I still believe that youll remember me

She mourns beneath the moonlit sky
Remembering when they said goodbye
Wheres the one he used to know
It seems so long ago

And when the golden sun arises far across the sea
The dawn will break as darkness fades forever well be free

Never forget what I did, what I said
When I gave you all my heart and soul
Morning will come and I know well be one
Cause I still believe that youll remember me

On lightless runway of your soul
Elbow their way through today
Those who yesterday couldn't live
But yesterdays have no significance

Over the dreams just for him, casting light﻿ onto his shadows
To bid farewell of memories which have holes

And yesterday will return for good with streams﻿ of light
Even the song will find it’s rhymes if I hold to him Ah… ah… ah… ah… I sense I am drawing to a close, a silent voice is singing in minor scale
However, the wind will not blow air into my white flags I believe that again, we will reconcile
And yesterday will return for good with streams﻿ of light

Kao bez glave sad zuris
Kuda, ne pitam
Jer ako pitam, ti sutis

I sve se teze rastajem
Od tebe I tvog tijela
I sve te manje poznajem
A nisam tako htjela

K'o da kradem te
Od svih, samo za sebe
Nek' te ostave
Nek' mi ne diraju tebe

I krv I dusu otrujem
Najgore kad te ranim
I opet sve to prezirem
Dok se pred tobom branim

Nemoj mi kvariti dan
Nikad mi nije bilo teze
Ti nisi zivio sam
U zlatu paukove mreze, kao ja
Zivot za tebe me veze
Da l' ce ikad lakse sve biti
Il' teze

Kad jednom cijeli zivot nas
Mirno na kocku stavis
K'o da nismo nikad rekli mi
Dok nas smrt ne rastavi

Where, I don’t ask, because if I ask, you stay silent
And it’s ever harder to part with you and your body
And I know you less and less, that’s not what I wanted It’s as if I’m stealing you away from everybody just for me
May they leave you, may they not touch you
I poisin blood and soul most when I wound you
And I still hate it all while I defend myself in front of you Don’t ruin my day, it’s never been harder for me
You’ve never lived alone in a spider’s web
Like I have, life connects me to you
Will it ever get easier or only harder, eh…. When you easily put our whole life in a gamble
As if we never said: “Till death do us part” Don’t ruin my day, it’s never been harder for me

Au-delà du jour, jusqu'à la nuit

Vodim te na igranku, na-na-na-na igranku
Oh, oh, oh, oh, igranku, vodim te na igranku
Vodim te na igranku, na-na-na-na igranku
Oh, oh, oh, oh, igranku, vodim te na igranku

[Verse 1: Who See]
Fešta je to, ne prestaje to, bit za bitom, vers za versom
Mrda se cio svijet s njom, jednim potezom i univerzum
'ajde vodi me, oslobodi me od gadnih stresova tokom godine
Ne mogu više da se paranojišem, na dobru feštu sve mi miriše
Igranka bez prestanka vanka, na podijum ili pored sama šanka
Dan kad svane tu smo, nikad nije pustoš
Ništa nije frka samo treba uć' u štos
Kik i bas zaraza razara, niko neće poć' utvrđenog pazara
Opet sjutra utabanim stazama, s mojima visim ne mislim o parama

[Chorus: Nina Žižić]
Nek' traje cijelu noć i cijeli dan
I biće još, biće još bolje, vjeruj mi
Jer mi smo stvoreni za to
Vodim te, vodim te, pođi za mnom ti
Pođi sa mnom sad
Ova noć je ta, ne vidi se kraj
Vodim te na igranku

[Verse 2: Who See]
Treba mi fešta što neće prestat' dok ženska treska komad mesnat
Vrućina kao u rernu na dvjesta, odosmo s mozgom, stroboskop bljecka
Bit ko blesav po glavi šiba, pregore kesa, piće mi sipaj
Gradele, česan, petrusin, riba, danu svega da se pokidam
I vodi me neđe da glavu produvam, neđe đe muzika dobro izuva
Pa da ne staje no samo da gruva, da svu noć traje i svi da su tuna
Pritisak trpi se, krpim se s mukom, vodi me neđe da baš ne bih puk'o
Načinjem limenku, život je čudo, 'ajmo na igranku, đe ćemo drugo

[Chorus: Nina Žižić]
Nek' traje cijelu noć i cijeli dan
I biće još, biće još bolje, vjeruj mi

I nije bitno to što svima je novčanik tanak

the whole world's shaking along with her,
with one move also and the universe. C'mon take me, free me,
from the nasty stress during the year,
I can no longer be paranoid,
it smells like a good party. The dance without stopping on the outside,
on a stage or near a bar itself,
when the day dawns, we're here, it's never a wasteland,
nothing's a big deal, you just need to get into a stunt. The kick and bass, they infect, they destroy,
nobody will come with established bazaars,
tomorrow again along the trodden paths,
I'm hanging out with my friends, I'm not thinking about the money. Ref.

it'll get more, it'll get more better trust me,
because we've been born for it,

this is the night,
the end can't be seen.
(I'm taking you to the dance) I need a party that'll never end,
while a woman shakes that piece of meat,
the heat is on 200 like in a microwave,
our brains'll explode, a stroboscope makes flashes. The beat is sick, it's banging on my head,
my wallet is empty, give me a drink,
a grill, a clove, a parsley, a fish,
give me everything to get fed. And take me somewhere to clear my head,
somewhere where the music is playing loud,
so that it doesn't stop, that it just keeps grooving,
that it lasts all night and that everyone are a tuna. The pressure is being suffered, I'm coping with struggle,
take me somewhere so that I don't explode,
I'm opening a can, life is a miracle,
let's go to the dance, where should we go else ? Ref.
Let it last all night and all day,
it'll get more, it'll get more better trust me,

music always will. (I'm taking you to the dance, to-to-to-to the dance)

I don't ask for apologies for all that I loved
For all I want my soul takes off
And I thank you for all you gave me If you remember me, tell me if I'll see you again
I'll always be waiting here for you For all that connected two hearts
For all we felt together, I miss you
And I'll be in you're most difficult goodbyes
In the sweetest of your ""I love you's"" If you remember me, tell me if I'll see you again
If you remember me, tell me if I'll see you again

2013,San Marino,Crisalide (Vola),"Certe volte dentro me
Ho sentito un vuoto che
Mi chiamava dentro di sé
Vieni ora a vedere la verità
C’è un ponte sull’immensità

Cosa sono in fondo
Io sogno fragile di Dio
Con un corpo fatto così
Grandi occhi colore vivendo si muore
Rinnovati per l’eternità

Vola, vola, che la forza arriverà
Sempre sola verso un’altra libertà
La farfalla nuova lascia sempre giù
La crisalide che eri tu
Vuota senza me

Dalle nuvole si sa
Poi la pioggia scenderà
D’improvviso succederà
Le ali bagnate di lacrime che non si asciugano
Poi vento verrà

E tu vola, vola, vola via da te
Sempre sola fino che un riflesso apparirà
Nello specchio che ruba l’immagine
In mille pezzi di vertigine
E luce scintillerà

Quanta vita c’è
Non me n’ero accorta mai
E se ancora non lo sai
L’universo siamo noi

Vola, che la forza arriverà
Mai più sola nella vera libertà
La farfalla nuova lascia giù
La crisalide e di più
Vuota senza me

Vola nella gioia sarai
Mai più sola nell’immensità di noi
In un attimo l’amore come nuovo sole
Tutto cambierà

Vola, vola, vola insieme a me","There were times when I felt
An emptiness inside of me
It used to call me
Come right now to see the truth
There's a bridge over immensity What am I after all
A fragile God's dream
With a body like this
Big colorful eyes, we die while living
Renewed for eternity Fly, fly and the strength will come
Always alone heading to another freedom
New butterfly always leaves
An empty chrysalis in which
you used to be Clouds are showing
That the rain will fall
It will happen all of a sudden
The wings are wet of tears and they can't be dried
And then the wind will come And you fly, fly, fly away from you
Always alone until the reflection appears
In the mirror that steals the image
In thousands of pieces of vertigo
And the light will shine So much life around
I never noticed it
And if you still don't know
We are the universe Fly, fly and the strength will come
Always alone heading to another freedom
New butterfly always leaves
An empty chrysalis in which
you used to be Fly into joy
You'll never be alone in our immensity anymore
In a moment love will change everything
like the new sun Fly, fly, fly with me",Italian,Crisalide (Vola),Ballad,Italian

The loneliness and quietness I chose. I have life, I have life, over hardship I drift.
I have life, I have life because of you.
When difficulties come, over mountains high, I climb
I have life, I have life, I have life. I didn't understand the love that made everything move
Was scared to embrace and to exist.
Felt I didn't deserve to open my mind
and let the bright light of love step in. I have life, I have life, over hardship I drift.
I have life, I have life because of you.
When difficulties come, over mountains high, I climb
I have life, I have life, I have life. And I believe, yes I believe
The beautiful sky might open
and the breathtaking love will flow over me. I have life, I have life, over hardship I drift.
I have life, I have life because of you.

I have life, I have life because of you.

Sostengono gli eroi: ""Se il gioco si fa duro è da giocare""
Beati loro, poi, se scambiano le offese con il bene
Succede anche a noi di far la guerra e ambire poi alla pace
E nel silenzio mio annullo ogni tuo singolo dolore
Per apprezzare quello che non ho saputo scegliere

[Ritornello]
Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Io compongo nuovi spazi e desideri che
Appartengono anche a te
Che da sempre sei per me l'essenziale

[Strofa 2]
Non accetterò un altro errore di valutazione
L'amore è in grado di celarsi dietro amabili parole
Che ho pronunciato prima che fossero vuote e stupide

[Ritornello]
Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Io compongo nuovi spazi e desideri che
Appartengono anche a te
Mentre il mondo cade a pezzi
Mi allontano dagli eccessi e dalle cattive abitudini
Tornerò all'origine
Torno a te che sei per me l'essenziale
L'amore non segue le logiche
Ti toglie il respiro e la sete

if the game gets hard, you have to play it
lucky them
if they confuse the offences with the good thing.
It also happens to us
to fight and then strive for peace
and in my silence
I take all your sorrow away
to appreciate everything that I couldn't choose While the world breaks into pieces
I compose new places and desires which
also belongs to you
from the beginning you are for me
the essential thing I won't accept
another error in valuation
love is capable of
hiding itself behind friendly words
which I have spoken before
they became empty and stupid While the world breaks into pieces
I compose new places and desires which
also belongs to you
from the beginning you are for me while the world breaks into pieces
I take distance from the excesses
and from the bad habits
I will return to the origins
I return to you, who is for me
the essential thing love doesn't follow the logic
it takes away your breath and your thirst while the world breaks into pieces

2014,Azerbaijan,Start a Fire,"Someone’s selling garden roses down the square
People gathering by to breathe the morning air
But no one sees the bitter cold and shivering empty hands

A school girl running by and trying to beat the bell
People dropping, tossing coins in wishing wells
But no one cares for dreams that don’t fit into our world

Maybe nightfall darkens skies
And maybe teardrops stain our eyes
But may the slightest light
Start a fire

A soldier in the hands of a forgotten mess
Digging out the burning bullets in his chest
So eager, bold and noble – printing footsteps on this earth

That often fades away in the night
And there it comes, that unwanted guest
There is no place for you tonight

‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

Like an evil satellite
Twisting the truth then leaving us alone
In this mad and moody world
Society without love

I state my heart has been well trained
I’m gonna be your candidate

Tonight I’m gonna eat you up

I press my nose to the glass
It’s raining outside, it’s raining outside
I would like to storm in
Roar like a lion, roar like a lion

But I fear your judgement, oh, I fear your judgement
I’m so wet, I’m dirty
But I fear your judgement, oh, I fear your judgement
It’s me and my imperfection

[Chorus] [x3]
Want me to go, want me to go
‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no","[Verse 1]
Looking for a candidate
You have an option, only one choice
Sipping my drinks, looking around
There’s so much beauty, oh, yes we can

But yet self-confidence is a fragile concept
That often fades away in the night
And there it comes, that unwanted guest
There is no place for you tonight

[Chorus]
Want me to go, want me to go
‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

[Verse 2]
Like an evil satellite
Twisting the truth then leaving us alone
In this mad and moody world
Society without love

I state my heart has been well trained
I’m gonna be your candidate
I am the hunter and you are the prey
Tonight I’m gonna eat you up

[Chorus]
Want me to go, want me to go
‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars

[Bridge]
I press my nose to the glass
It’s raining outside, it’s raining outside

[Verse 1]
He's got a pen in his hand
A piece of paper staring back
He could write like a man
A novel life, back on track

Maybe a drama or a poem
But still he doesn't, no
The time is ticking in his ear
The holy silence disappears

[Chorus]

She tries to feel; she can't feel anything

When you long to feel alive
And take the chance to give it up

Quelque chose me manque, mais quoi? Je veux-ci je veux ça!
Quand j'dors, j'fait des rêves en dollars, tous les jours, j'ai un nouveau costard
Chez moi tout est neuf, tout est beau, le monde pleure derrière mes rideaux
J'm'en fous, j'habite au dernier étage, j'connais même pas ma femme de ménage
Y'a du cuir, dans ma voiture, l'odeur de mon parfum me rassure
Je n'aime pas montrer mes émotions à la salle de musculation
Je soulève quelques poids et haltères, mon corps est une machine de guerre
J'ai tout ce qu'on rêverait d'avoir, j'ai peut-être tout c'est vrai mais moi j'voulais une moustache

Une moustache, une moutache
I wanna have a moustache
Une moustache, une moutache

[Strofa 1]
Cântec de-ar fi viața mea
Vesel, trist, tot l-aș cânta
Nu aș rata nicio notă...
Râu de-ar fi, l-aș înota
Pân' la mare, l-aș urma
Nu m-aș opri niciodată...
Știi că
Viața n-are buton de rewind
Să poți să întorci ce-ai pierdut
Nu poți nici să o pui pe pauză
Când nu știi ce-i de făcut

[Refren]
Dacă mâine noaptea n-ar mai avea vreo stea
Dacă întruna vântul, spre mine, ar sufla
Tu ai fi motivul, tu ai fi motivul să pot
Să pot s-o iau de la capăt
Dacă mâine cerul ar fi prea plin de nori
Dacă nicio rază nu m-ar atinge-n zori
Tu ai fi motivul, tu ai fi motivul să pot
Să pot s-o iau de la capăt

[Strofa 2]
Aș zbura chiar și-o noapte-ntreagă
Spre zorii-n care ai fi tu
Ploile n-ar putea să-nțeleagă
De ce nu cad când sunt tot ud

[Refren]
If the stars tomorrow no longer shine on us
If a strong wind takes me and I will turn to dust
You will be the reason, you will be the reason to start
To start all over again
If the sky clouds over, with darkness never gone
If the sun stays hidden, not waking in the dawn
You will be the reason, you will be the reason to start
To start all over again

[Outro]
To start all over again...
To start all over again...
To start all over again...
Să pot s-o iau de la capăt...","It is ugly at us and Dunarea dried. Why did you promise me … why don’t you come during summer? If my life was a song,
Happy, sad, I would still sing it.
I wouldn't miss a single note.
If it was a river, I would swim,
To the sea I would fallow,
I would never stop.
Remember
Life doesn't have a rewind button to
Be able to regain what you have lost,
You can’t even pause it
When you don’t know what to do. (Chorus:)
If tomorrow night would be without a star,
If the wind would continuously blow towards me,
You would be the reason; you would be the reason to be able …
To be able to start from the beginning.
If tomorrow the sky would be full of clouds,
If no sun ray would touch me in the morning,
You would be the reason; you would be the reason to be able …
To be able to start from the beginning. I have so much to tell you. The heart is like a crane,
That flies towards warmer countries
When there is winter in the soul.
Maybe will not find them,
Maybe will crash.
But will never quit,
Remember.
I would fly all night long
Towards the morning, if it was you,
The rain wouldn't be able to understand
Why I am wet without any rain drops. (Chorus:)
To be able to start from the beginning.
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
To be able to start from the beginning.",Romanian/English,,,

I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbay. Rosemary has blossomed, white lily has bent,
Everything smells like sorrow.

But my heart is still pining for you. I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,

I’ve been walking in the darkness
Always hiding from my true self
Afraid of letting go, of deception in their eyes
A wounded ego, unafraid to start a fight

2015,Cyprus,One Thing I Should Have Done,"Tonight the rain is falling
I’m feeling cold, and I’m

I gave you my heart, you gave me yours too
You’d make me feel I was really someone

One day you think you have it all
The next you’re staring at the wall…in a dream
The road that once was paved with gold
Has turned a rusty shade
Of all the saddest colours in the world
Now my life’s in tatters

2015,France,N'oubliez pas,"Il ne me reste que des larmes
Ces quelques notes venues d'autrefois
Et le chant de nos prières
Nos cœurs qui espèrent
Et le vide sous mes pas

Il ne me reste que les cendres
De mon village plongé dans le silence
Je ne suis qu'une blessure
Un cœur sans armure
Comment survivre après ça

Mais je suis là, je n’oublie pas
Dans mon village balayé par l’histoire
Et je vis là, n’oubliez pas
Effacé des cartes et des mémoires

Je me souviens du rire des enfants
La voix des hommes quand ils partaient au champ
Les fêtes des moissons
L’odeur dans les maisons
Les éclats d’amour et de joie

Mais je suis là, n’oubliez pas
Effacé des cartes et des mémoires

Quand ils sont arrivés
Cachés derrière leurs armes
Ils étaient des milliers
Ils riaient de nos larmes

Ils ont voulu détruire
Nos croyances et nos âmes
Avec des mots de haine
Que l'on n'connaissait pas

Je suis ici ce soir
Au milieu de ces ruines
Pour vous parler d'espoir
Et vous chanter la vie
Et je fais le serment
Quand séchera le sang
De reconstruire ma ville
Bien plus belle qu'avant

Mais n’oubliez pas","Tears are everythig, that is left for me
These few notes from the past
And the melody of our prayers
Our hearts, that are hoping
And the emptiness beneath my steps Ashes are everything, that is left for me
Of my village plunged into silence
I am only a wound
A heart without armour
How to survive after this? But I am there, I don't forget
In my village swept away by history
And I live there, don't forget
Erased from the maps and memories I remember the laughter of children
The voices of the men leaving for the field
The harvest celebrations
The smell inside the houses
The bursts of love and joy But I am there, don't forget
Erased from the maps and memories When they arrived
Hidden behind their weapons
They were thousands
They laughed at our tears They wanted to destroy
Our beliefs and our souls
With words of hatred
That we didn't know I am here tonight
In the middle of these ruins
To talk to you about hope
And to sing about life
And I make the promise
That when the blood will dry
I will rebuild my city
Even more beautiful than before But don't forget",French,N'oubliez pas,Ballad,French

Wherever you are.
Today I challenge oblivion. He left not knowing

And she lures me with her curves after a glass or two of wine
But she ain’t the one who’s gonna give me a son tomorrow

How can I mix red and blue together?
Beautiful days and stormy weather

And making itself a path in my chest without putting off its voice
And I don't feel tension any more, only life, inside me No degree of separation
No type of hesitation
There isn't any division between us any longer
We're a single direction in this world that moves There's no degree of separation
I gave less space to the heart and more to reason
Always a step back and with my soul on alert
And I watched the world from a door
That was never completely open
And from afar
And no, there's no hesitation, finally, inside me There is no degree of separation
There is no degree of hesitation
There is no degree of space between us

Until I, I got close enough

[Chorus 1]
If I were sorry
I'd give you all the glory
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
It would be a different story
If I were sorry
If I were sorry, oh

[Bridge]
Did you ever realize
That your mistake had a price?
Oh, you threw it all away
Cause you're the devil in disguise
Now would you ever realize
The consequences of your lies?
And would you save the falling tear
Or act as if there's nothing there?
If I were sorry
(If I were sorry)
If I were sorry
(If I were sorry)

[Chorus 2]
If I were sorry
I'd take a vow of silence
Wouldn't say a single word
(If I were sorry)
If I were sorry
I'd be on my hands and knees, beggin' ""pretty please""

But I'm not sorry, no",English,If I Were Sorry,Pop,English

[Verse 1]
The story of us
Is it already told?
Let's tear the book apart
Start to rewrite it all
We're already gone
But still in this together
Like a dragon to its gold
We're still holding on

[Pre-Chorus]
Our life will wait for us to live
We don't need a lifetime to figure out what we miss
The love we get is the love we give
I'm only just full of love that we're here to give

[Chorus]
This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
Lonely in a crowded room together
Tell me who's scared now?

This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
Playing house in these walls forever
Tell me who's scared now?

[Post Chorus]
Can we get an alternate ending?
Can we get an alternate ending?
Oohh

[Verse 2]
Somehow we will change
Everything that we touch
But we held on too tight
And changed it too much
We sweep up this love
Put the pieces back together
And if we find more
Can we bring this to life?

[Verso 1]
Se um dia alguém perguntar por mim
Diz que vivi para te amar
Antes de ti só existi
Cansado e sem nada para dar

[Refrão]
Meu bem, ouve as minhas preces
Peço que regresses, que me voltes a querer
Eu sei que não se ama sozinho
Talvez devagarinho possas voltar a aprender

[Refrão]
Meu bem, ouve as minhas preces
Peço que regresses, que me voltes a querer
Eu sei que não se ama sozinho
Talvez devagarinho possas voltar a aprender

[Verso 2]
Se o teu coração não quiser ceder
Não sentir paixão, não quiser sofrer
Sem fazer planos do que virá depois
O meu coração pode amar pelos dois","If one day someone asks about me
Say that I lived just to love you
Before you, I only existed
Tired and without a thing to offer My dear, listen to my prayers
I ask you to come back, that you come back to love me
I know we can't love alone
Maybe little by little you can learn again My dear, listen to my prayers
I ask you to come back, that you come back to love me
I know we can't love alone
Maybe little by little you can learn again If your heart doesn't wish to do so
To feel the passion, If it doesn't want to suffer
Without making plans about what will happen
My Heart can love for the both of us",Portuguese,Amar pelos dois,Ballad,Portuguese

Like a bullet from a smoking gun
They try to tell us that we don't belong
Creeping 'round at the depth of night
Just two shadows in love, we were ghosts
Two hearts, we're invincible

Haunted by if it's wrong or right

Like a burning desire
Taking me higher
Walk in a wire
We will never come down

Running faster at the speed of light
Falling deeper, got you in the sight

Sosem változik bennem

Nem kérek már belöled
Menj el innen hagyj engem
Ne is lássalak téged
Átkozott légy örökre

Jálomá lommá, jálomá lommá
Jálomá lommá lomalom
Jálomá lommá, jálomá nédinná
Jálomá lommá, lomálom

Engem négyévesen megszólított az Isten
Egy igazi fegyvert adott a kezembe
Tudtam, csak ö vigyázhat rám
Többet gyakoroltam vele mint egy szamuráj
Benne bízhatok, mindig az igazat mondja
Vele sírhatok, de az utat mutatja
Ez egy olyan szövetség, ami marad örökké
Fel nem áldozható, ö a legföbb kincsem

Sejtelmes erök laknak a gyerekben
Félnek töle, látszik a szemekben
A húrjaim támadnak, sírnak a testekbe
Hiába is véded ki, méreg a hangszerbe
Nagy tömegeket itattam át vele
Hallod a dallamom, már tudod a nevemet
Hosszú az út, sebek a hátamon
Ezrek könnyei folynak a gitáromon

Jálomá lommá, jálomá lommá
Jálomá lommá lomalom

Yaloma lomma, lomalom God was talking with me, when I was 4 years old.
I knew only he can take care of me
I was practicing with it a lot like a samurai.
I can trust Him, he will always tell the truth
I can cry with Him, and he will show the way.
This alliance will remain forever
We are inseparable, he is the most supreme treasure. Mysterious forces were in childhood.
They were afraid of him, he appears in the eyes.
The strings are attacked, the body is crying
You defend yourself unnecessarily, as if it is a poison in a instrument.

While punching on a bag and I’m choking
I’m looking for a sign while they’re stepping on my mind
But I hide behind a simpleminded notion
I'm trying to act cool but I’m boiling
I'm feeling like a fool that was chosen
Try to keep myself calm
While my head was getting bombed

All the faces you see on your way
Have a story they could tell
Tiny traces of life’s joy and sorrow
Why can’t we treat each other well

We all have a choice we can make
There’s always a choice we can make
To help and to heal in different ways
Too many are dying in vain
Together we could ease the pain
If somehow we could ease the pain

There’s a word for love and for blame
Different voices, cultures, and people, and places

2018,Albania,Mall,"Një pritje e gjatë, e ëmbël e zjarrtë
Ca hapa trokasin si zemër këtë natë
Unë ndjek ritmin e saj
Dy duar që zgjaten përpijnë në ngrohtësi
Ky mall që të djeg nuk njeh kufi as largësi

Asgjë në këtë botë nuk mund ta shprehë dot ndjesinë
Kur zemrat bashkohen dhe prapë rrahin si një

Dua të hesht në këtë natë i shtrirë në këtë shtrat
Ku ëndrrat hyjnore shërojnë çdo plagë
Të shoh portretin e saj
Momentet kalojnë, sekondat nuk falin
Orët pasojnë por ndjenjën se ndalin, jo

Si më magji hëna shikimet përpin
Më sjell vegimin tënd

Lot i patharë ndriçojë këtë natë
Sonte kumbo prej shpirtit pa fjalë
Vetëm një çast dhimbja të më ndalë

Ky lot i patharë një ditë do shterojë
Nga puthjet e zjarrta që ëndërroi
Në atë çast dhimbja do ndalojë

E ëmbël kjo jetë por nuk njeh kufi
Hërë na përkëdhel, hërë na krijon largësi
Ty të kam larg
Më bën të luftoj kur fuqitë kanë shteruar
Të ëndërroj edhe kur zgjuar jam

Si më magji hëna shikimet përpin
Sytë tanë puqën sërish edhe pse është fantazi
Jetën do ta fal ty

Lot i patharë ndriçojë këtë natë
Sonte kumbo prej shpirtit pa fjalë
Vetëm një çast dhimbja të më ndalë

Ky lot i patharë një ditë do shterojë
Nga puthjet e zjarrta që ëndërroi

sweet and fiery
A few steps beat like a heart tonight
I follow her rhythm
Two hands that guide feel the warmth
This yearning that burns doesn`t know boundaries nor distance Nothing in this world can explain this feeling
when two hearts unite and beat like one I want to hush tonight lay in this bed
where the divine dreams heal every wound.
To see her portrait
Moments pass by
seconds don`t forgive
hours go but they can`t stop the feeling, no As by magic, the moon gazes our stares
it brings me your vision. Undried tear, enlighten this night
resound today from the silent soul.
Just a moment the pain stops me
This undried tear will drain one day
from the fiery kisses it dreamed
at that moment the pain will stop. Sweet this life, but it knows no boundaries
sometimes it caresses us, sometimes it separates us
I have you far away
You make me fight when my powers have given out
I dream of you even when I am awake As by magic, the moon gazes our stares
our eyes meet again, even though it is a fantasy
I will give my life to you.",Albanian,Mall,Rock,Albanian

Sometimes it feels like it's meant to be broken
Sometimes we long for the unspoken

Sometimes it seems we're at the wrong station
Looking for a deadly combination

Looking for all these cheap sensations

Against all their advice
We keep running, we keep on running

And melt the snow
To warm up the one, who felt cold in the night
Shine not for me
For us
For us
Make the heart feel joyful for the others' happiness The sun rises in time
To grant People warmness
And the earth keeps turning with love Let understand the feelings of others share with others
What is the heart if not break into nine pieces to with others
The wind will carry the rest away
You own only what you share Day breaks the night
If I am by your side
Something ends and there Comes a new start
Kindness will live forever on the earth For you
For love
For just one Flash
We go on our way
All is yours what you share",Georgian,For You,Pop,Georgian

Sure she had it right, there was nothing to lose
Oh no, apart from life I was born this morning

Whom the sea took away

Gave its chance back to our survival

A Il Cairo non lo sanno che ore sono adesso
Il sole sulla Rambla oggi non è lo stesso
In Francia c'è un concerto, la gente si diverte
Qualcuno canta forte, qualcuno grida ""A morte""
A Londra piove sempre ma oggi non fa male
Il cielo non fa sconti neanche a un funerale
A Nizza il mare è rosso di fuochi e di vergogna
Di gente sull'asfalto e sangue nella fogna

[Strofa 2: Fabrizio Moro]
E questo corpo enorme che noi chiamiamo Terra
Ferito nei suoi organi dall'Asia all'Inghilterra
Galassie di persone disperse nello spazio
Ma quello più importante è lo spazio di un abbraccio
Di madri senza figli, di figli senza padri
Di volti illuminati come muri senza quadri
Minuti di silenzio spezzati da una voce
Non mi avete fatto niente

Non mi avete fatto niente
Non mi avete tolto niente
Questa è la mia vita che va avanti

Non mi avete fatto niente
Non avete avuto niente

C'è chi si fa la croce, chi prega sui tappeti
Le chiese e le moschee, gli imam e tutti i preti
Ingressi separati della stessa casa
Miliardi di persone che sperano in qualcosa

Braccia senza mani, facce senza nomi
Scambiamoci la pelle, in fondo siamo umani

E non esiste bomba pacifista

Sono consapevole che tutto più non torna

Come vola via una bolla","In Cairo people don't know what time is it now
Today the sun over the Rambla is not the same
There's a concert in France, people are having fun
Someone's singing loudly, someone's screaming ""to death"" It always rains in London, but today it's fine
The sky doesn't make concessions, not even at a funeral
In Nice the sea is red for fires and shame
With people on the concrete and blood in the sewer And this enormous body that we call earth
Wounded in its organs from Asia to England
A galaxy of people lost in space
But the most important one is the space for an hug From childless mothers, from children without a father
From faces enlightened like walls without paintings
Minutes full of silence, broken by a voice

You took nothing from me

Beyond everything, beyond the people You did nothing to me
You gained nothing
Because everything goes beyond

Churches and Mosques. Imams and all the priests
Separated entries in the same house
Billions of people that hope for something Handless arms, nameless faces
Let's change our skin we are humans deep down
'cause our lives are not a point of view
And it doesn't exist a pacifist bomb You did nothing to me
You took nothing from me
This is my life that goes on
Beyond everything, beyond the people You did nothing to me

Porzucone serce które nic nie czuje
Światu obojętne, twarde jak głaz
Ale gdy przyspieszy, samo się rozkuje
Doda oczom blasku, nadrobi czas

Burns us alive
Love me now, love me now
Harder and harder
Take me there, be the air I need to survive","Fire! Fire! Fire of love! Sitting on an iceberg
Waiting for the sun
Hoping to be rescued
Cold and alone
One small spark becomes a flame
By the floating wind of the spring fields It is burning! It is burning
A fire of love
It is burning inside us! It is burning inside us
Like a dry forest
Love me! Love me!
More and more
It will not help! It will not help!
The fire brigade A lonely heart
That is only in doubt
As it has never been hugged
Is frozen in ice
A ray of promise
Can melt this ice
It will be set free
By the voice of love It is burning! It is burning
A fire of love
It is burning inside us! It is burning inside us
Like a dry forest
Love me! Love me!
More and more
It will not help! It will not help!
The fire brigade An excited heart
That does not feel anything
Is indifferent to the world
Hard as a stone
But when it is in a hurry
It will unchain itself
It will make the eyes sprakle
During the time on the road It is burning! It is burning
A fire of love
It is burning inside us! It is burning inside us
Like a dry forest
Love me! Love me!
More and more
It will not help! It will not help!

Burns in you, burns in me
Burns us alive
Love me now! Love me now!

Ko težko je tvoje breme

You can listen to my heart beating
When your burden is heavy
You can take refuge in me Ask me what keeps me going
It's achievements and distances
When a leaf goes with the wind and resists it
I go with the flow and resist it The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you 1 There are tears in your eyes
Let them keep falling
When our wishes differ
You accept me and I accept you Look at me...
... that everything has a meaning 2 Eternity and this planet are not friends
I, as well, am but a snowflake that's waiting for spring to come The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you You needn't prove yourself
The same tears and the same fear bind us The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you",Slovene,Sebi,Ballad,Slovene

2019,Hungary,Az én apám,"[Verze 1]
Az én apám úgy nevelt, mint a szél
Halkan fújt, énekelt, úgy mesélt
Ott lakott, hol minden út véget ért
Ezeregy év is kevés egy életért, egy életért

[Verze 2]
Hallom őt, az ő szívét a húrokon
Látom őt, múló idővel az arcomon
Az ő hitét büszkeség vallanom
Ezer egy dalból azt az egyet dúdolom, dúdolom

[Refrén]
Régi napok, gyönyörű napok
Szeretem az emlékét
Ő hív, és hozzá szaladok
Játszani így volt szép
Régi dalok megidézik
Még érzem a nap fényét
A szél zúgasát is hallom még
A szél hangjában is hallom még

[Verze 3]
Egy dallal űzte messze el a bánatom
Mit adhatok, csak az, hogy hozzá tartozom
S az én fiamnak büszkeséggel mondhatom
Ő az én apám, és itt az én otthonom

[Refrén]
Régi napok, gyönyörű napok
Szeretem az emlékét
Ő hív, és hozzá szaladok

A szél fütyült altatót, legyen álmom szép
A szél fütyült altatót, ma is hallom még","My father raised me like the wind
Blowing softly, singing, telling fairy tales
He lived where every road ended
One thousand and one years aren’t enough for a life, for a life I can hear him, his heart on the strings
I can see him, bearing the passing time on my face
I’m proud to confess his faith
Of a thousand and one songs this is the one that I hum Old days, beautiful days
I love his memory
He calls me and I run to him
That was a lovely way to play Old songs summon him
I still feel the sun's light
I can still hear the drone of the wind
I can still hear him in the voice of the wind With a song he drove my sadness far away
All I can give him is that I belong to him
And I can say to my son with pride
He's my father, and here's my home Old days, beautiful days
I love his memory
He calls me and I run to him
That was a lovely way to play Old songs summon him
I still feel the sun's light

The wind whistled a lullaby, I can still hear it today",Hungarian,Az en apam,Ballad,Hungarian

All my life I've wondered why
I keep fighting all the tides

[Verso 1]
Eu parti o telemóvel
A tentar ligar para o céu
Pa' saber se eu mato a saudade
Ou quem morre sou eu

[Refrão 1]
E quem mata quem
Quem mata quem mata?
Quem mata quem?
Nem eu sei
Quando eu souber, eu não ligo a mais ninguém

[Verso 2]
E se a vida ligar
Se a vida mandar mensagem
Se ela não parar
E tu não tiveres coragem de atender
Tu já sabes o que é que vai acontecer
Eu vou descer a minha escada
Vou estragar o telemóvel, o telelé
Eu vou partir o telemóvel
O teu e o meu
E eu vou estragar o telemóvel
Eu quero viver e escangalhar o telemóvel
E se eu partir o telemóvel?
Eu só parto aquilo que é meu
'Tou para ver se a saudade morre
Vai na volta, quem morre sou eu

[Refrão 2]
Quem mata quem mata?
Eu nem sei
A chibaria nunca viu nascer ninguém

[Outro]
Eu partia telemóveis
Mas eu nunca mais parto o meu
Eu sei que a saudade 'tá morta
Quem mandou a flecha fui eu
Quem mandou a flecha fui eu
Fui eu","I broke my phone
Trying to call up to heaven
To find out if I kill off my saudade1
Or if I'm the one who dies
Who kills whom?
Who kills whom?
Will it kill?
Who kills whom?
Not even I know
When I find out
I won't call another soul If life calls you up
If life sends you a message
If it doesn't stop
And you don't have the courage to pick up
You already know what'll come next
I'll go downstairs
And I'll wreck my phone, the ol' celly
I'll break the phone
Both yours and mine
And I'll wreck my phone
I want to live and obliterate my phone And what if I break my phone?
I'll only have broken what belonged to me
I have yet to see if my saudade will die
It turns out I'm the one who dies
Who kills whom?
Will it kill?
I don't even know The sensationalists have never seen anyone be born
I used to break phones
But I never break mine anymore
I know that my saudade is dead

I am me
And I know I will always be
Je suis free
Oui, j'invente ma vie
Ne me demandez pas qui je suis
Moi je suis le même depuis tout petit
Et malgré les regards, les avis
Je pleure, je sors et je ris

[Pre-Refrain]
You put me in a box
Want me to be like you
Je suis pas dans les codes
Ça dérange beaucoup
At the end of the day
You cannot change me, boo
Alors laisse-moi m'envoler

[Refrain]
I, I'm not rich but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
Quand je rêve, je suis un roi
Quand je rêve, je suis un roi
I'm not rich but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
Quand je rêve, je suis un roi

[Post-Refrain]
And I kno-o-o-ow
Even tho-o-o-ough
You tried to take me down
You cannot break me, na, na
Toutes ces voix
Fait comme ci, fait comme ça
Moi je ne cala pas
You will never remove my crown

[Couplet 2]
Who are we?
When we hurt, when we fight for free
Only God can judge you and me
Ce qu'on est, on ne l'a pas choisi
On choisit
Son travail, sa coiffure, ses amis
Sa routine, parfois l'amour aussi
Ça passe ou ça casse mais ça regarde qui?

[Refrain]
I, I'm not rich but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
Quand je rêve, je suis un roi
Quand je rêve, je suis un roi
I'm not rich but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
Quand je rêve, je suis un roi

And I kno-o-o-ow
Even tho-o-o-ough
You tried to take me down
You cannot break me now
Toutes ces voix
Fait comme ci, fait comme ça
Moi je ne cala pas
You can never remove my crown

[Outro]
Je suis un roi
Quand je rêve, je suis un roi","I am me
And I know I will always be
I am free
Sure I am inventing my life
Don't ask me who I am I am
The same since I was very little
And in spite of looks, opinions
I cry, I go out and I laugh You put me in a box
Want me to be like you
I don't follow the codes
People are disturbed a lot
At the end of the day
You canno change me, boo !
So, let me fly I'm not rich but i'm shining bright
I can't see my kingdom now
When I dream, I am a king
When I dream, I am a king
I'm not rich but i'm shining bright
I can't see my kingdom now
When I dream, I am a king
And I know o-o-ow
Even now o-o-ow
You try to take me down
You cannot break me nah nah
All these voices
Do like this, do like that
I don't look right through them
You'll never remove my crown Who are we ?
When we hide, when we fight for free
Only god can judge you and me
We did not choose what we are We choose
Our work, our hairstyle, our friends
Our routine
Sometimes love too
It's make or break but it's none of your business I'm not rich but i'm shining bright
I can't see my kingdom now
When I dream, I am a king
When I dream, I am a king
I'm not rich but i'm shining bright

In periferia fa molto caldo
Mamma stai tranquilla, sto arrivando
Te la prenderai per un bugiardo
Ti sembrava amore ma era altro
Beve champagne sotto Ramadan
Alla TV danno Jackie Chan
Fuma narghilè, mi chiede come va

[Pre-Ritornello]
Mi chiede come va, come va, come va
Sai già come va, come va, come va
Penso più veloce per capire se domani tu mi fregherai
Non ho tempo per chiarire perché solo ora so cosa sei
È difficile stare al mondo
Quando perdi l'orgoglio
Lasci casa in un giorno
Tu dimmi se

[Ritornello 1]
Pensavi solo ai soldi, soldi
Come se avessi avuto soldi, soldi
Dimmi se ti manco o te ne fotti, fotti
Mi chiedevi come va, come va, come va
Adesso come va, come va, come va

[Strofa 2]
Ciò che devi dire non l'hai detto
Tradire è una pallottola nel petto
Prendi tutta la tua carità
Menti a casa ma lo sai che lo sa
Su una sedia lei mi chiederà

[Pre-Ritornello]
Mi chiede come va, come va, come va
Sai già come va, come va, come va
Penso più veloce per capire se domani tu mi fregherai
Non ho tempo per chiarire perché solo ora so cosa sei
È difficile stare al mondo
Quando perdi l'orgoglio
Ho capito in un secondo
Che tu da me

[Ritornello 2]
Volevi solo soldi, soldi
Come se avessi avuto soldi, soldi
Prima mi parlavi fino a tardi, tardi
Mi chiedevi come va, come va, come va
Adesso come va, come va, come va

[Bridge]
Waladi waladi habibi ta'aleena
Mi dicevi giocando, giocando con aria fiera
Waladi waladi habibi, sembrava vera
La voglia, la voglia di tornare come prima

[Pre-Ritornello]
Io da te non ho voluto soldi
È difficile stare al mondo
Quando perdi l'orgoglio
Lasci casa in un giorno
Tu dimmi se

[Ritornello 3]
Volevi solo soldi, soldi
Come se avessi avuto soldi, soldi
Lasci la città ma nessuno lo sa
Ieri eri qua, ora dove sei papà?
Mi chiedi come va, come va, come va
Sai già come va, come va, come va","It's really hot down in the suburbs
Mama don't worry I'm on my way home
You will be upset by a liar
It looked like love to you, it was something else He's drinking champagne during Ramadan
On tv they are airing Jackie Chan
He's smoking Shisha and asks me how I'm doing He asks me how I'm doing doing doing
You alredy know how things are going going going
I think faster to try to figure out if you're going to fool me tomorrow
I have no time to clear things up 'cause I finally found out what you are
It hurts to be alive
When you lose your pride
You leave home out of the blue You, tell me if
You only cared for the money money
As if you had any money
Tell me whether you miss me or you don't give a fuck You used to ask me how I was doing doing doing
Now how are things going going going
What you're supposed to say you haven't said yet
Betrayal is a bullet in your chest Keep all the compassion to yourself
You keep lyin' at home but you know she knows
Sittin' there she'll be asking me Asking me how I'm doing doing doing
She already knows how things are going going going
I think faster to try to figure out if you're going to fool me tomorrow
I have no time to clear things up 'cause I finally found out what you are
It hurts to be alive
when you lose your pride
I figured it out in one second, from me You only wanted the money
As if I had any money
Back then you would talk to me till late You used to ask me how I'm doing doing doing
Now how are things going going going
My son, my son, darling, come over here [Arabic]
You used to tell me while playing your games with pride
My son, my son, darling, [Arabic] It felt so real to me
Wanting to bring things back to what they were I didn't ask you for your money...
It hurts to be alive
When you lose your pride
You leave home out of the blue You, tell me if
Only cared for the money money
As if I had any money You leave the city without anybody knowing
Yesterday you were here, where are you now, papa?
You ask me how I'm doing doing doing
You already know how things are going going going",Italian (Arabic),Soldi,Pop,Italian

[Verso 1]
Te compran porque te vendes
Te vendes porque te sobras
Te pierdes porque hay camino
Te digo: hay otras cosas

Te sales porque te quieres
Te quieres, tu mente en forma
Te eliges porque hay camino
Te digo: hay otras cosas

La venda ya cayó, avivando fantasías
La venda ya cayó y serás como querías

Te rezas porque confías
Te sientes que ya tenías
Te vives, alto voltaje
Te traje buenas noticias

Te vives y te interesas
Te saltas, no quedan normas
